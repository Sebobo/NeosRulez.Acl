## Installation

The NeosRulez.Acl package is listed on packagist (https://packagist.org/packages/neosrulez/acl) - therefore you don't have to include the package in your "repositories" entry any more.

Just run ```composer require neosrulez/acl``` and ```./flow doctrine:update``` to create the database table.
